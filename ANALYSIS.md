# Coder Jam Feedback

1. Photo doesn't load in README.md file.
2. Directory is labeled notbooks, but in repo navigation it is called notebook. Mispelling can cause confusion and looks unprofessional.
3. Repository is incomplete.
4. Git commits are either blank or do not specify changes made to README.md.
5. test.ipynb is an invalid file and unable to be opened.
